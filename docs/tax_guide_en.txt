TAX OBLIGATIONS GUIDE
FOR NON-PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PROVIDERS

Dear HomeFix Greece partner,

This document provides basic information about your tax obligations as a non-professional service provider. Please note that this information is general, and we recommend consulting with an accountant for your personal situation.

1. INCOME TAX DECLARATION

All income you receive through the HomeFix Greece platform must be declared in your annual tax return (E1 form) as "Income from occasional provision of services" in Section 4Z.

For each service you provide, you must issue a service receipt using the template we provide and keep a copy for at least 5 years.

2. INCOME LIMITS AND TAXATION

If your total annual income from occasional services does not exceed €10,000, it is taxed at a rate of 9%.

Example:
If you earn €5,000 through the platform in one year:
- Tax: €5,000 x 9% = €450

If the income exceeds €10,000, the normal tax scale rates apply, and you may need to register a business activity. Consult an accountant in this case.

3. SPECIAL SOLIDARITY CONTRIBUTION

Incomes up to €12,000 are exempt from the solidarity contribution.

4. INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS

If you provide occasional services and do not have a business activity, you usually don't have an obligation to pay insurance contributions to EFKA (Greek Social Security).

However, if your annual income exceeds a certain limit or you provide services systematically, registration with EFKA may be required. Consult an accountant for more information.

5. KEEPING RECEIPTS

It is important to keep all receipts you issue as well as copies of the monthly reports sent to you by HomeFix Greece.

Also keep receipts for any expenses related to providing your services, as you may be able to deduct them from your taxable income.

6. HOW TO USE THE RECEIPT TEMPLATE

For each service you provide:

1. Fill out the receipt template with all required information
2. Issue the receipt in duplicate
3. Sign both copies
4. Give one copy to the customer and keep the other for your records

IMPORTANT NOTE:

If your income from providing services increases significantly or you provide services regularly, you may need to consider starting a business activity. This entails different tax and insurance obligations. HomeFix Greece can guide you through this process when needed.
